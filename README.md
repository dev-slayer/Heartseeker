# Heartseeker
Start as a weakling, with the essence of your life fragmented across the world for you to gather to become stronger than ever.

This mod takes direct inspiration from Terraria's [Life Crystals](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Life_Crystal), starting the player off with just three hearts, forcing them into exploration to find more. You'll have to track down these crystals in the rarest of places to complete your health pool, making the beginning of your adventure incredibly perilous, but in the end all the more rewarding.
